# The Context

Quadratic funding is the hype nowadays! And a third party staking protocol is using the concept in one of their ETH staking pools. The more percentage of ETH you have there compared to the rest of the stakers, the more percentage of rewards you get from the whole pool.

The very cool new kids on the block have seen an opportunity there and have created an AMM with regular staking pools plus an aggregated ETH staking pool. They have called it the Very Cool AMM. The ETH staking pool will add ETH to the third party from a single contract in the protocol, thus increasing the percentage of ETH staked for that single account. Huge rewards are expected from the aggregated ETH staking pool!

For now there is only one aggregated ETH staking pool in the protocol, controlled by the team. The users can add their own regular staking pools to the system or use the pre-existing ones, the team doesn't care. As far as the big juicy aggregated ETH pool gets bigger and bigger!

You get a look at the contracts: they seem simple and they seem to follow good practices. But...what is that? Is that what you think? The Big Juicy ETH Pool just got even juicier!
